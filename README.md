# Fundamentals of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for the book "Fundamentals of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Deep Learning" by Nylan Richard. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to linear algebra with a focus on its applications in machine learning and deep learning.

## Book Description
The book aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and their practical applications in modern AI. Starting from basic concepts accessible to beginners, the content progresses to advanced topics that underpin modern machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Chapter 1: Introduction** - Overview of linear algebra's importance in ML/DL
- **Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts** - Scalars, vectors, matrices, operations, and systems of linear equations
- **Chapter 3: Intermediate Concepts** - Determinants, matrix inverses, vector spaces, and linear transformations
- **Chapter 4: Advanced Concepts** - Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix decompositions (LU, QR, SVD)
- **Chapter 5: Applications to ML/DL** - PCA, data compression, dimensionality reduction, and optimization techniques

Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and exercises with detailed step-by-step solutions to reinforce understanding.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of algebra and calculus
- No prior knowledge of linear algebra is required as the book starts from basics
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts is helpful but not necessary

## Compiling the LaTeX Document

### Required Packages
The document requires the following LaTeX packages:
- `inputenc` (with UTF-8 encoding)
- `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, `amssymb` (for mathematical typesetting)
- `graphicx` (for including figures)
- `tikz` (for creating diagrams)
- `geometry` (for page layout)

### Compilation Steps
1. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
2. To compile the document, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pdflatex main.tex
   pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice for proper cross-references
   ```
3. The resulting PDF will contain the complete book with properly formatted mathematics, diagrams, and layout
